# You can also add more specific rules or information, e.g.,
# [rule: Avoid direct database access outside of database.py]
# Database operations should be performed through functions within database.py.

# [rule: Command logic should reside in commands.py]
# Slash command processing logic should be written in commands.py, and only called from main.py.
